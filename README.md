# Plan todo
Plan todo is an app to store all your plans. I built it inspired by a David Allen diagram on the book "Getting things". More info about it on [plan todo's web](https://plan-todo.com).

## Tech stack
Plan todo is a project I chose to build, basically, to prove myself my recently acquired javascript abilities. So, it has no framework whatsoever. I built it with vanilla JS and vanilla CSS too (since it is a simple project, I didn't feel the need to use a framework).

## About this repo
Feel free to use this repo for your own projects. You can have a look at the way the localStorage works, also the draconian way I came up with to delete the list items from the mockup DB ðŸ˜…. The UI overall was tricky to build when it came to positioning each container to left, center or right, and hav it show up at a specific point of the page. I hope you can use the little tricks I used.
