# Plan todo
Plan todo is an app to store all your plans. I built it inspired by a David Allen diagram on the book "Getting things". More info about it very soon on [plan todo's webapp](https://plan-todo.com).

## Tech stack
Plan todo is a project I chose to build, basically, to prove myself my recently acquired javascript abilities. So, it has no framework whatsoever. I built it with vanilla JS and vanilla CSS too (since it is a simple project, I didn't feel the need to use any framework).

## About this repo
Plan todo's code is completely open to anyone that wants to use it or fork it. If you want to make it yours altogether, reach me and we can work it out.

The code is overall not very complicated. All the main containers are `div`s on the UI, they appear or dissappear by just changing it's `display` property. And on the storage side, it all works with `localStorage`.

You can have a look at the way the `localStorage` works, also the draconian way I came up with to delete the list items from the mockup DB ðŸ˜…. The UI overall was tricky to build when it came to positioning each container to `left`, `center` or `right`, and have it show up at a specific point of the page. I hope you can use the little tricks I used.
